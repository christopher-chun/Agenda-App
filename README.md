# Agenda App
This agenda app allows users to add tasks to keep track of events or to simply make a list. 
## Description
The user of this app can input tasks to add it to a list. Every task in the list has a circle and a cross next to it. The user can press the circle to indicate that the task has been finished. They can also press the cross in order to remove it from the list. The user can also clear the entire list at once with the clear tasks button on the bottom. This app also includes a trash list so any tasks that get removed from the task list get added to the trash list. The trash list functions almost identically to the task list. If the user presses the cross on a task in the trash list, the item is completely removed. If the user presses the circle next to a task, it is removed from the trash list and moved back to the bottom of the task list. The trash list also has a function to clear the entire list and the user can press the close button to open and close the trash list at will. Both lists store the tasks that are being added so the user can exit the app and come back with all the tasks still loaded.
